			<p>Project management requires much asking<br>
Of clients and coders for more info<br>
So that a PM can get to tasking<br>
in Basecamp, Jira, or maybe Trello.<br>
But before productive action can start<br>
five basic questions need some addressing.<br>
These <em>W</em> queries allow the heart<br>
of a project to beat without stressing.</p>
<p>When newspapers report on the here’n now<br>
All are asked the Five: <em>who, what, when, where, why</em><br>
(Plus the anti-alliterative <em>how</em>)<br>
To separate truth from black-hearted lie.<br>
These words can help PM pre-production<br>
workflows work without any obstruction.</p>
<h2 id="whowhat">Who/What</h2>
<p>Who is requesting the task to be done?<br>
Hopefully one with authorizing writ.<br>
Nothing’s worse than delivering a ton<br>
of code your main stakeholder ne’er green-lit.<br>
But approved work needs timely assigning<br>
by the PM, who does the budget checks,<br>
to a single assignee, defining<br>
who will do what; What’s what we’ll ask for next.<br>
What needs to be done is estimated.<br>
Both effort and outcome identified<br>
We get on the same page by what’s stated<br>
The approval process is also eyed.<br>
With the who and the what firmly nailed down<br>
PMs can move on to When-n-where Town.</p>
<h2 id="whenwhere">When/Where</h2>
<p>Slotting in work depends when it is due,<br>
But also when can we start on our code?<br>
The budget might not allow immediate action,<br>
So know when to begin and when to be done.<br>
And since we don’t code like cowboys risking,<br>
When can this work be sent to production?<br>
And where is production code sent whisking?<br>
Where will staging code endure construction?<br>
And there are more wheres that need to be known,<br>
Like where will we track task conversation<br>
And where to track time as efforts are sown.<br>
(Untracked time causes PM frustration.)<br>
With all aforementioned finally filed,<br>
Seek out the tamers of projects most wild.</p>
<h2 id="whyhow">Why/How</h2>
<p>Because it was there, Mallory labored<br>
Summiting peaks as if they were hillsides<br>
But change for change’s sake is like a jaybird<br>
Spinning through space on a whimsy joyride.<br>
Why work is sought out is crucial to find;<br>
The code must target an issue to thrive.<br>
Issues mean metrics to keep top of mind<br>
To suss out success once code work goes live.<br>
Lastly is how, as in <em>How is this solved?</em><br>
Let your dev team handle all this thinking<br>
After, you should understand what’s resolved;<br>
Give space at first for solution linking.<br>
Your workflow will flourish when firstly fed<br>
these basic questions, John metrically said.</p>
