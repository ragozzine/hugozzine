      <description>Being a scrum master, I often worry if velocity looms too large for me. From project forecasting to sprint planning to team retrospectives, velocity metrics are up in my grill more than bratwurst at a Green Bay Packers tailgate. Even from a “book learnin’” standpoint, velocity is front and center: “The Scrum Master is accountable for the Velocity &amp;hellip; of the Team. ” That big V Velocity is really intimidating! But does velocity warrant such verbal (and mental) emphasis?</description>

      <description>It was the best of sprints, it was the worst of sprints.
 One reason I find scrum so invigorating stems from its reliance on compiling lots and lots of data. Back when I was getting my English degree, I never would have imagined how much I love plugging numbers into spreadsheets and adding formulas to those sheets that makes the numbers show me things. I think it’s the same instinct that gave me great pleasure in alphabetizing my CD collection in a giant black binder (back when I actually needed stacks of physical media on my person to enjoy music).</description>

      <title>Sprint Velocity - How Scrum Predicts the Future</title>

      <description>A common question I am asked is “How will scrum deliver my projects on time?” and the honest answer is: it may not. Scrum is not a cure-all that can somehow force 10lbs of crap into a 5lbs bag. If a project contains too much scope and not enough time to do everything nothing can change that (especially not by adding more people to the mix).
That said, the power of scrum comes from its ability to make visible the data necessary to develop a fairly accurate completion window.</description>
