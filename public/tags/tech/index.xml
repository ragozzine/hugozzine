      <title>Rejecting Master for Main</title>

      <description>Recently, I launched a new open source project. Unofficially called the Last First Letter Collab , the story is built using a writing pattern: a sentence’s first word must begin with the previous sentence&amp;rsquo;s last word&amp;rsquo;s last letter.
While creating the repo on GitHub, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the default branch, heretofore always named master, was now called main.
We all know that words carry power. A person’s word choice can make or break a conversation, a motto, or even a simple salutation.</description>

      <title>Leaving WordPress for GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>I’ve been a WordPress user since 2007 , continuously maintaining personal writing sites. I grew along with the product, moving from a casual hobbyist suffering through the Famous 5-minute Install to a WordPress professional, making my living from the open source CMS.
And while WordPress is a solid foundation for many web projects, a blog isn’t one of them anymore. Often derided as being “just for blogs,” WordPress’s product roadmap has steadily veered further and further from a platform for low-volume sequential writing with each jazzy release.</description>

      <title>Creating an Ideal Epic</title>

      <description>What I like most about managing projects with Jira is the level of organization and filtering I can achieve by tagging tickets. As someone who used to keep his CD collection in alphabetical order by artist (with secondary ordering done by year), the tagging options help me structure projects in a deeply satisfying way—except for labels, which totally bite (mostly).
While not everyone uses components or fix versions (though you SHOULD) just about everyone who manages projects in Jira ought to make use of epics.</description>

      <title>Hide on Mobile - A `Display None` Allegory</title>

      <description>Once upon a time, a traveler entered a nondescript pizza palace. On each of the red-and-white clothed tables were squat shakers of parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper. The air smelled of garlic, oregano, and all the trappings of traditional East Coast pizzerias.
The traveler approached the counter, surveying the options available. Pepperoni sounded good. “Shopkeep! I’d like a pepperoni slice, if you will.”
A mustachioed man, wiping his hands on a stained, white apron, waddled out from the kitchen.</description>

      <title>Being Bitten by Bytes</title>

      <description>Collective nouns are single words for a group of things and I love them all (except for “guys”—that’s a bad one). I especially enjoy animal group names. Get three or more bears together, and it’s known as a sleuth. Same with a pride of lions, a bale of turtles, or a romp of otters. Bird collectives have the best names : a murder of crows, a chain of bobolinks, a deceit of lapwings.</description>

      <title>What Is a CDN? A Visual Explanation</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/cdn/</link>

      <description>A CDN (Content Delivery Network ),more commonplace in hosting plan offerings, is a must for any business site. By hosting web content on servers spread across the globe, content can be delivered to a user faster by using relatively localized servers.
But if you’re like me, you are not overly technical; you get the concept of a CDN in theory, but do you GET IT get it? Here’s my nontechnical take on what a CDN is and why it’s a true benefit for any website.</description>
