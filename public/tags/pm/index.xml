      <description>What I like most about managing projects with Jira is the level of organization and filtering I can achieve by tagging tickets. As someone who used to keep his CD collection in alphabetical order by artist (with secondary ordering done by year), the tagging options help me structure projects in a deeply satisfying way—except for labels, which totally bite (mostly).
While not everyone uses components or fix versions (though you SHOULD) just about everyone who manages projects in Jira ought to make use of epics.</description>

      <description>Project management requires much asking
Of clients and coders for more info
So that a PM can get to tasking
in Basecamp, Jira, or maybe Trello.
But before productive action can start
five basic questions need some addressing.
These W queries allow the heart
of a project to beat without stressing.
When newspapers report on the here’n now
All are asked the Five: who, what, when, where, why
(Plus the anti-alliterative how)</description>
