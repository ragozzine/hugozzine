      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that having one, solitary new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is a bit of a cop-out. A single resolution, while admirable, is invariably too simple to fail (eat more salad) or too massive to be measurable (be a better person).

-1. I’m assuming you’re writing electronically. If your method is pen and paper, that’s really cool, but not what I am doing here. I will say that writing stuff out can be helpful for steps 1 and/or 2, but I find it just delays the true editing process.</description>
