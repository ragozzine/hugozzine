      <description>As a scrum master and coach, I see the phrase “doing scrum wrong” thrown around a lot. Scrum practitioners often worry about making missteps, while detractors lambast scrum as being unrealistic and too rigid for how “the real world works.” In both cases, scrum is cast as a magical route through a maze of death traps (i.e. any project ever). Deviate from this hallowed path and you will surely wind up impaled at the bottom of a spike pit or crushed by a surprisingly spherical boulder.</description>
