      <title>Rejecting Master for Main</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/master-to-main/</link>

      <description>Recently, I launched a new open source project. Unofficially called the Last First Letter Collab , the story is built using a writing pattern: a sentence’s first word must begin with the previous sentence&amp;rsquo;s last word&amp;rsquo;s last letter.
While creating the repo on GitHub, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the default branch, heretofore always named master, was now called main.
We all know that words carry power. A person’s word choice can make or break a conversation, a motto, or even a simple salutation.</description>

      <title>Velocity Is a Means, Not an End</title>

      <description>Being a scrum master, I often worry if velocity looms too large for me. From project forecasting to sprint planning to team retrospectives, velocity metrics are up in my grill more than bratwurst at a Green Bay Packers tailgate. Even from a “book learnin’” standpoint, velocity is front and center: “The Scrum Master is accountable for the Velocity &amp;hellip; of the Team. ” That big V Velocity is really intimidating! But does velocity warrant such verbal (and mental) emphasis?</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Capacities</title>

      <description>It was the best of sprints, it was the worst of sprints.
 One reason I find scrum so invigorating stems from its reliance on compiling lots and lots of data. Back when I was getting my English degree, I never would have imagined how much I love plugging numbers into spreadsheets and adding formulas to those sheets that makes the numbers show me things. I think it’s the same instinct that gave me great pleasure in alphabetizing my CD collection in a giant black binder (back when I actually needed stacks of physical media on my person to enjoy music).</description>

      <title>Rule of Scrum</title>

      <description>As a scrum master and coach, I see the phrase “doing scrum wrong” thrown around a lot. Scrum practitioners often worry about making missteps, while detractors lambast scrum as being unrealistic and too rigid for how “the real world works.” In both cases, scrum is cast as a magical route through a maze of death traps (i.e. any project ever). Deviate from this hallowed path and you will surely wind up impaled at the bottom of a spike pit or crushed by a surprisingly spherical boulder.</description>

      <title>A Fair Way to Get Up to Par with Reference Stories</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/reference-stories/</link>

      <description>Story pointing can feel a little wishy-washy, especially on teams that are new to scrum. While the inherent ambiguity to point estimation belies its power, folks need some place to hang their hat in grasping this concept.
Time estimation feels so much safer to people because of its universality. Time zones be damned, but an hour in New York City is the same span of time as an hour in Paris, Melbourne, or Bangkok.</description>

      <title>Sprint Velocity - How Scrum Predicts the Future</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/sprint-velocity-future/</link>

      <guid>https://ragozzine.me/blog/sprint-velocity-future/</guid>
      <description>A common question I am asked is “How will scrum deliver my projects on time?” and the honest answer is: it may not. Scrum is not a cure-all that can somehow force 10lbs of crap into a 5lbs bag. If a project contains too much scope and not enough time to do everything nothing can change that (especially not by adding more people to the mix).
That said, the power of scrum comes from its ability to make visible the data necessary to develop a fairly accurate completion window.</description>

      <title>2019 Resolutions - Three Pluses, Two Minuses</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/2019-resolutions/</link>

      <guid>https://ragozzine.me/blog/2019-resolutions/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that having one, solitary new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is a bit of a cop-out. A single resolution, while admirable, is invariably too simple to fail (eat more salad) or too massive to be measurable (be a better person). Better to aim for that overlapping sweet spot of the Venn diagram, maximizing both quality and quantity.
That being said, here are my goals for 2019.

      <title>Leaving WordPress for GitHub Pages</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/wp-to-github-pages/</link>

      <description>I’ve been a WordPress user since 2007 , continuously maintaining personal writing sites. I grew along with the product, moving from a casual hobbyist suffering through the Famous 5-minute Install to a WordPress professional, making my living from the open source CMS.
And while WordPress is a solid foundation for many web projects, a blog isn’t one of them anymore. Often derided as being “just for blogs,” WordPress’s product roadmap has steadily veered further and further from a platform for low-volume sequential writing with each jazzy release.</description>

      <title>Creating an Ideal Epic</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/jira-epic/</link>

      <description>What I like most about managing projects with Jira is the level of organization and filtering I can achieve by tagging tickets. As someone who used to keep his CD collection in alphabetical order by artist (with secondary ordering done by year), the tagging options help me structure projects in a deeply satisfying way—except for labels, which totally bite (mostly).
While not everyone uses components or fix versions (though you SHOULD) just about everyone who manages projects in Jira ought to make use of epics.</description>

      <title>Hide on Mobile - A `Display None` Allegory</title>

      <description>Once upon a time, a traveler entered a nondescript pizza palace. On each of the red-and-white clothed tables were squat shakers of parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper. The air smelled of garlic, oregano, and all the trappings of traditional East Coast pizzerias.
The traveler approached the counter, surveying the options available. Pepperoni sounded good. “Shopkeep! I’d like a pepperoni slice, if you will.”
A mustachioed man, wiping his hands on a stained, white apron, waddled out from the kitchen.</description>

      <title>WordPress, In Crisis</title>
      <link>https://ragozzine.me/blog/wordpress-crisis/</link>

      <description>One of the selling points for (the free software that is) WordPress is its user friendliness. Intuitive, accessible, open—all of these words are at the root of what WordPress is and why it is of such benefit to the publishing world. I largely agree with this.
That said, I know I am an insider (albeit peripherally) to the WordPress community, so need to remember that I am an unreliable narrator. Still, inspired by the wonderful book “Design for Real Life“ by Sara Wachter-Boettcher and Eric Meyer , I&amp;rsquo;m taking a critical eye to my CMS of choice.</description>

      <description>Word choice is important, a fact not lost on famed Norse explorer Eric the Red . When he discovered a semi-inhabitable landmass northwest of his native Iceland, he knew he needed a snappy name to attract settlers. How else would you get people to move to a giant, rocky ice slab roughly the size of the midwestern United States ?And so he dubbed it “Greenland” and tapped into the verdant dreams of his people, thereby successfully pulling off the greatest bait-and-switch ever.</description>

      <description>Collective nouns are single words for a group of things and I love them all (except for “guys”—that’s a bad one). I especially enjoy animal group names. Get three or more bears together, and it’s known as a sleuth. Same with a pride of lions, a bale of turtles, or a romp of otters. Bird collectives have the best names : a murder of crows, a chain of bobolinks, a deceit of lapwings.</description>

      <description>The writing process can make your brain feel like processed cheese (not to mention your self-esteem). Here are 10 steps for writing that will help you bridge the gap between one-and-done-drafts and that book chapter you’ve been rewriting for years.
-1. I’m assuming you’re writing electronically. If your method is pen and paper, that’s really cool, but not what I am doing here. I will say that writing stuff out can be helpful for steps 1 and/or 2, but I find it just delays the true editing process.</description>

      <title>QA Will Give Me a Bug-free Website and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves</title>

      <description>If you work for a large corporation or on a project with limitless coffers, you have likely enjoyed working with a dedicated QA team. You build the website or oversee the coding efforts then hand off your labors to a separate team who systematically kicks the tires and identifies bugs with your work, reporting back on everything.
But, for the bulk of web work, QA and testing is not done by a standalone team with that single purpose.</description>

      <description>Project management requires much asking
Of clients and coders for more info
So that a PM can get to tasking
in Basecamp, Jira, or maybe Trello.
But before productive action can start
five basic questions need some addressing.
These W queries allow the heart
of a project to beat without stressing.
When newspapers report on the here’n now
All are asked the Five: who, what, when, where, why
(Plus the anti-alliterative how)</description>

      <title>The Cost of a Basic WordPress Site</title>

      <description>Stop me if you heard this one. A person walks up to a web developer and asks, “So how much would it cost for, like, a basic website?” We’ve all been there and have tried to explain that “it depends” without coming off sounding like a shyster.
“But you work with WordPress and I heard it was so easy you could use it right out of the box! I don’t want anything fancy; I’m just wondering what it would cost for a basic WordPress site.</description>

      <title>What Is a CDN? A Visual Explanation</title>

      <description>A CDN (Content Delivery Network ),more commonplace in hosting plan offerings, is a must for any business site. By hosting web content on servers spread across the globe, content can be delivered to a user faster by using relatively localized servers.
But if you’re like me, you are not overly technical; you get the concept of a CDN in theory, but do you GET IT get it? Here’s my nontechnical take on what a CDN is and why it’s a true benefit for any website.</description>

      <description>Working from home can be an amazingly fulfilling career experience. Likewise, a trip to your local Chinese food buffet can be a culinary delight. But both can also be abjectly horrible. Here is my breakdown on how to succeed at working remotely without the debilitating pains of post-dumpling bloat. Dress the part I am a great defender of Chinese food buffets. I know the food is not some five star affair, but damn it, I like it.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the WordPress Writing Experience</title>

      <description>Before I was a web professional, before all the project management, front-end coding, and CMS rejiggering, I was an English major. My BA is in writing and, as such, I tend to approach most things I do from the stance of an author.
That being said, the Author User Experience (AUX) of WordPress has been on my mind for a while now. To me, regardless of use, WordPress is about sharing content: articles, images, audio, video.</description>

      <description>The words we use communicate shades of meaning that we might not want. Here’s a list of seven words that I strive to not use when discussing a project with a client or with my team.
1. Should This is the cardinal sin of any client communication. “We should be able to get back to you midweek.” “This code should fix the issue you are seeing.” Should is a wishy-washy, slouching word of ill repute.</description>
