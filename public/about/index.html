			<p>I&rsquo;m the Director of Agile Process at <a href="https://alley.co/">Alley</a>, a fully remote web agency running Scrum@Scale. The Scrum Master on the data visualization team, I work closely with all of Alley’s SMs, both as a collaborator and an Agile Coach.</p>
<p>I host a podcast, <a href="http://twoscrumsup.com/">Two Scrums Up</a>, which focuses on sharing Agile anecdotes, successes, and missteps. New episodes come out every Tuesday.</p>
<p>I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="me-before-now">Me, Before Now</h2>
<p>I grew up in Connecticut, but not the one you are picturing. Think working class Long Island mixed with the South Boston characters of <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. I was a smart, shy kid brought up by a stable, funny, big Italian-American family. Pretty sure I was asked, &ldquo;Hey, how youse doin?&rdquo; daily.</p>
<p>After a childhood of puns, 80s TV, and tromping around the woods behind our house with our dog, I attended Marist College—mostly due to the campus&rsquo;s amazing view of the Hudson River—eventually earning a BA in English with unofficial minors in Philosophy and Theater.</p>
<p>After an early 2000s stint in textbook publishing as well as teaching, I started my career in technology by building WordPress websites for nonprofits in Maine. Through self-teaching, I moved up in the web development world, eventually being a UX/UI Development Manager (a title I created to accompany a promotion) at a large financial company.</p>
<p>Since the early 2010s, I have been working in the agency world, exclusively for fully remote organizations.</p>
