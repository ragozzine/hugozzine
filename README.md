# Hi, I'm John!

These are the content and theme files that make my personal site: (ragozzine.me)[ragozzine.me]

## Every time I deploy code (my own little cheatsheet)

In **project folder**

`./deploy.sh "a commit message"`

Go back into **project folder**
```
git add .
git commit -m "a commit message"
git push origin master
```
